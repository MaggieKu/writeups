I ran the game.gb file on the BGB GameBoy Emulator. 

The game is a maze that allows the user avatar to fall through a left or a right channel a total 10 times before displaying the end of game screens. 
If you fall through the channels in incorrect ordering, you lose the game. 

To find the way through the maze, I looked for patterns that would indicate the order in the debugging console.

There are 10 lines with the suffix "joypad". If "a" is before "(ff00 + 00)", go through the right channel; otherwise go through the left. That 
would take you to the end of game screen with the flag.
