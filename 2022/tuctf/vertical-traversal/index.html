<p>The site is clearly using regular expressions to block access to any paths containing a <code>/</code>, but <code>%2f</code> unescapes to the same thing and is not detected.</p>
<p><code>..</code> is also replaced with <code>.</code>, so using <code>...</code> causes the first <code>..</code> to be replaced with <code>.</code>, leaving us with <code>..</code>.</p>
